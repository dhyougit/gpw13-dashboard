<h1>GPW13 Dashboard</h1>

This project creates a publicly accessible dashboard and database of global health indicators focused on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the 13th General Programme of Work (GPW). There are three main components of this project:

<h2>1. Database</h2>

The database includes health indicators for 194 countries that are 'Member States' of the World Health Organisation (WHO). While the focus is on the SDGs and GPW13 indicators, key global health indicators from reproductive, maternal, neonatal, child and adolescent health, noncommunicable diseases, communicable diseases, and summary measures are included.

Data sources include publicly accessible datasets from the WHO such as the World Health Statistics, Global Health Estimates and the Global Health Observatory.

<h2>2. Dashboard</h2>

These customisable dashboards will empower users to develop country profiles on current health status and health trends. The dashboards include a mix of charts and summary data.

<h2>3. Comparative Charts</h2>

Given that users are often interested in benchmarking countries with other countries - either at a similar level of economic development or at an aspirational level - these comparative charts offer an opportunity to do so for all indicators. Comparisons can be performed across countries, within and across regions, and by benchmarking against global standards.
